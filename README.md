## Reqio

Reqio is a simple native desktop HTTP client created with Electron, Webpack, and Yarn. It is a great tool for testing APIs locally and experimenting with different HTTP requests.

### Getting started with Reqio

To start Reqio locally, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kannananil/reqio.git
cd reqio
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start Reqio by running the following command:

```bash
yarn start
```

This will start the Reqio application in a new window.

### Building Reqio

To build Reqio for production, run the following command:

```bash
yarn build
```

This will create a new directory called `dist` which contains the built Reqio application.
