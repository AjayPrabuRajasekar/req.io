# Together, we build greatness: Your Contribution Matters!

Thank you for considering contributing to our project! We appreciate your time and effort. To ensure a smooth and collaborative process, please follow these guidelines.

### Getting Started
- Ensure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) and are signed in. 
- Fork this repository to your GitHub account. 
- Clone your fork to your local machine.

### Creating issues
If you spot a problem with the code or docs or have a suggestion, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue. Be sure to include a clear and detailed description.

### Solve an issue
Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/req-io/req.io/issues) to find one that interests you. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix. Be sure to get the issue assigned to your name to avoid conflicting/spammy PRs.

**Note**: Please refrain from pushing directly to the main branch. Always create a pull request for your changes.

#### Commit Message Conventions
We recommend following the below structure for a commit message<br>
```
[<issue-number>] | <contributor(s)> | small description
```

Examples:
```
[11] | Steve | Add support for headers in get request
[23] | Anant/Anugrah | Support for PUT requests
```

#### Branching Strategy
Create a new branch for your feature, bug fix or doc update. Use a descriptive name that reflects the nature of your changes.
```
git checkout -b feature/your-feature
```
Instead of feature, use `bug/` or `docs/` according to the use case.
Once changes are checked and committed, push your branch to your forked repository.
```
git push origin feature/your-feature
```

Regularly pull changes from the main branch to keep your feature branch up to date. On reaching a logical point in the solution, create a pull request using the guidelines mentioned below. 
#### Pull Request Guidelines
1. Before submitting a pull request, ensure that your code adheres to the coding style of the project.
2. Provide a clear and descriptive pull request title and description.
3. Don't forget to link PR to issue you are working on.
4. Make sure your commits are well-structured with clear commit messages. 
5. Squash your commits into a single logical commit where appropriate. 
6. Ensure that your pull request is up-to-date with the latest changes from the main branch.

By following this strategy, we can maintain a clean and organized version history, making it easier to track and manage changes effectively.<br>
**Note**: We have built the contributing guidelines taking reference from [GitHub's guide on contributing to project](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects). Please let us know your suggestions and help us improve the guidelines!
